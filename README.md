# python-api-challenge
 Repository for a python project. Objective was to analyze weather conditions globally and by Northern and Southern hemispheres based on 4 metrics,  
 developing plots to describe the data, and to create a heatmap using gmaps weighted on humidity and overlay it with markers indicating which hotels  
 can be found in cities matching "ideal" weather conditions.
